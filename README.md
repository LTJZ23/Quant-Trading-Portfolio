# Quant-Trading-Portfolio
A collection of quantitative trading strategies by [LTJZ23](https://github.com/LTJZ23).

## Strategies Included
1. **Project 1 (Monte Carlo Simulation)**  
   Estimates the fair price of a European call option using Monte Carlo simulations.
2. **Project 2 (Volatility Arbitrage)**  
   Uses the Black-Scholes model to identify arbitrage opportunities by comparing implied volatility (IV) with realized volatility (RV).
3. **Project 3 (Cointegration)**  
   Implements pairs trading using cointegration, rolling hedge ratios, and Z-score signals.
4. **Project 4 (Options Arbitrage Tracker)**  
   Tracks TSLA options for arbitrage opportunities by comparing market prices to theoretical prices from Black-Scholes and Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) models. Generates BUY/SELL signals with a 20% price difference threshold.
5. **Project 5 (Volatility Arbitrage - Delta Neutral Tracker)**  
   A delta-neutral volatility arbitrage strategy that compares Historical Volatility (HV) to Implied Volatility (IV) for SPY options. Identifies mispriced options and suggests trades with Take Profit (TP) at Â±2% absolute HV change and Stop Loss (SL) at 70% (longs) or 130% (shorts) of entry price.

## Purpose
This portfolio showcases my progress in quantitative trading, from basic simulations to advanced arbitrage strategies. Each project is a work in progress, with plans to refine and expand functionality.
